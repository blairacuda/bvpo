Many families rely on the school meals provided to stretch their budgets and provide food for their families. BV raises funds and purchases food items and/or gift cards to grocery stores to meet these needs during the long Thanksgiving, Winter, and Spring breaks. The money and food that is donated goes directly to families in our school. BV families are able to make anonymous requests for the food baskets/gift cards to meet their needs. This food drive is run by volunteers, with support of BV staff, and donations are made by the families at BV as well as local grocery stores and farms in our area."/>
